## Current State vs. Desired State

### 🔴 Current State: Idea-to-Production Pipeline
```
💡 Idea → 💻 Code → 🚀 Production → 🔥 Issues → 🛠️ Fix → 📋 Document (Maybe)
    |         |         |           |         |         |
   Quick    Direct    Live         React    Patch     After-fact
  Decision  Implementation Testing   to Issues in Prod  Planning
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Fast initial delivery
- ❌ High stress during critical periods (month-end)
- ❌ Repetitive issues and technical debt
- ❌ Knowledge silos and poor handover capability
- ❌ Difficult to scale team or add features

### 🟢 Desired State: Structured Development Cycle
```
💡 Idea → 📋 Plan → 💻 Develop → 🧪 Test → 🚀 Deploy → 📖 Document → 🔄 Iterate
    |       |        |          |        |         |           |

```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Predictable delivery timelines
