## 4. Creating a New Project

### 4.1 Project Creation Request

All new projects must be approved by the **Technical Lead** before creation. To request a new project:

1. Submit a request in **Jira** under the "Project Requests" board.

2. Include the following details:
   - **Project Name**: Clear and descriptive name.
   - **Project Description**: Purpose and scope.
   - **Project Owner**: Primary person responsible.
   - **Expected Timeline**: Start and estimated completion dates.
   - **Initial Task List**: Key milestones and deliverables.

3. The **Technical Lead** reviews the request and, upon approval, proceeds with project setup.

### 4.2 Project Setup

Once approved, the **Technical Lead** or an authorized team member will:

1. Navigate to **Jira > Create Project**.

2. Select the **appropriate project template** (e.g., Software, Business, or Kanban).

3. Configure the following settings:
   - **Project Key**: Short unique identifier.
   - **Permissions**: Assign appropriate roles (e.g., Developer, Reporter, Viewer).
   - **Workflow**: Choose default or custom workflows based on project needs.
   - **Issue Types**: Configure tasks, bugs, and epics as required.

4. Confirm and create the project.

## 5. Project Tracking and Management

### 5.1 Task Breakdown

- All work is tracked as **Jira Issues** within the project.
- Common issue types include:
  - **Epic**: High-level project milestone.
  - **Story**: Functional requirement.
  - **Task**: Development or operational work unit.
  - **Bug**: Defects requiring resolution.

### 5.2 Issue Tracking and Status Management

- Issues progress through the **defined workflow**:
  1. **To Do** -- Task identified but not started.
  2. **In Progress** -- Task is being actively worked on.
  3. **In Review** -- Work is completed and awaiting approval.
  4. **Done** -- Task is completed and closed.

### 5.3 Sprint and Backlog Management

- **Backlog Grooming**: The Technical Lead ensures tasks are prioritized based on business requirements.
- **Sprint Planning**: For Agile projects, the team conducts sprint planning at the beginning of each cycle.
- **Monthly Progress Review**: Ensures alignment with reporting cycles and executive expectations.

### 5.4 Communication and Updates

- **Slack Integration**: Notifications for project updates are pushed to relevant channels.
- **Weekly Standups**: Quick updates on progress, blockers, and next steps.
- **Monthly Reports**: Summary of completed work and pending tasks.

## 6. Success Metrics

To measure project tracking effectiveness, the following KPIs are monitored:

- **Issue resolution time** (average time to completion).
- **Sprint completion rate** (percentage of planned work completed per sprint).
- **Backlog size and trend** (monitoring outstanding tasks over time).
- **Stakeholder satisfaction** (feedback surveys from executives and team members).

## 7. Continuous Improvement

- The **Technical Lead** conducts a quarterly review of Jira usage and project management effectiveness.
- Adjustments to workflows and tracking mechanisms will be made as needed.
