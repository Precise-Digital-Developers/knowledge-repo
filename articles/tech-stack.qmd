## Client Dashboard Platform

The client dashboard represents our most significant technology evolution, introducing a modern fullstack application stack for serving artists and labels with real-time data, royalty statements, and account management.

```{r dashboard-stack, echo=FALSE}
dashboard_stack <- data.frame(
  Technology = c("Next.js 16", "React 19", "TypeScript 5", "Tailwind CSS 4", "shadcn/ui", "tRPC v11", "TanStack Query v5", "Supabase", "Zod v4", "Playwright"),

)

kable(dashboard_stack, caption = "Client Dashboard Technology Stack") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), font_size = 12, full_width = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, color = "#e4002b")
```

### Framework & Runtime

-   **Next.js 16 (App Router)**: Our primary fullstack framework, providing server-side rendering, React Server Components, file-based routing, and built-in API capabilities. The App Router architecture enables route groups for separating public and authenticated areas of the application.

-   **React 19**: Latest version of React with concurrent rendering features, used as the core UI library across all dashboard components.

-   **TypeScript 5 (Strict Mode)**: All dashboard code is written in strict TypeScript, with generated database types from Supabase ensuring end-to-end type safety from database to UI.

### UI & Styling

-   **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility-first CSS framework used for all styling, with the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin for optimized builds.

-   **shadcn/ui + Radix UI**: Pre-built, accessible component library providing consistent UI primitives (dialogs, dropdowns, tabs, toasts, etc.) styled with Tailwind and `class-variance-authority` for variant management.

-   **Lucide React**: Icon library used throughout the interface.

-   **Chart.js + react-chartjs-2**: Data visualization for royalty analytics, streaming performance, and financial reporting dashboards.

-   **react-simple-maps**: Geographic visualizations for regional streaming analytics.

### API & Data Layer

-   **tRPC v11**: Type-safe API layer that eliminates the need for manual API contracts. tRPC routers define server procedures that are directly callable from React components with full TypeScript inference.

-   **TanStack Query v5 (React Query)**: Manages all server state, providing automatic caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates. Integrated with tRPC for seamless data fetching.

-   **TanStack Table v8**: Headless table library for building complex, sortable, and filterable data grids for royalty statements, catalogue listings, and activity logs.

### State Management

-   **Zustand v5**: Lightweight state management used for client-side application state, particularly authentication state management.

-   **Jotai v2**: Atomic state management for fine-grained reactive state where component-level state sharing is needed.

### Forms & Validation

-   **React Hook Form v7**: Performant form library with minimal re-renders, used across all dashboard forms.

-   **Zod v4**: Runtime schema validation with TypeScript type inference. Zod schemas are co-located with tRPC routers for API validation and shared with frontend forms via `@hookform/resolvers`.

### Backend & Database

-   **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service providing:
    -   **PostgreSQL Database**: Primary relational database with generated TypeScript types
    -   **Supabase Auth**: Authentication and session management with SSR support via `@supabase/ssr`
    -   **Edge Functions**: Serverless compute for backend logic
    -   **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live data updates via WebSocket connections
    -   **Storage**: File upload and management for assets
    -   **Supabase CLI**: Local development environment and database migrations

### Email & Notifications

-   **React Email + Resend**: Professional email templating with React components, delivered via the Resend API. Used for registration invites, password resets, and collaboration invitations.

-   **Slack Webhooks**: Integration for support notifications and operational alerts.

### Testing & Quality

-   **Playwright**: End-to-end browser testing framework configured with Chromium for automated UI testing, with screenshot and video capture on failure.

-   **ESLint v9**: Code linting with `eslint-config-next` for Next.js-specific rules.

### Architecture Patterns

The client dashboard follows a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

-   **Server Layer**: Domain models, application use cases, repository pattern, and infrastructure services (email, auth, storage, logging)
-   **Shared Layer**: Zod schemas and TypeScript types shared between server and client
-   **Client Layer**: React components organized by feature (auth, accounts, profile, notifications, catalogue)
-   **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail infrastructure built into the domain layer
