# Change Control Guide

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes a structured change control process for the management of product modifications. Its purpose is to serve as a guide such that changes are requested, categorized, reviewed, approved, and implemented in a controlled manner, aligning with business objectives and technical feasibility.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all changes related to the development and maintenance of technical projects at Precise Digital. It covers feature enhancements, bug fixes, infrastructure modifications, and other technical updates.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** -- Oversees overall technical direction and approves high-level strategic changes.
- **Technical Lead** -- Acts as the intermediary between executives and developers, managing expectations, prioritizing tasks, and ensuring feasibility.

  - Must adhere to the change control process (Note: Currently limited by free Jira version supporting only 3 team members)
  - Can request changes but must follow the outlined process.

## 4. Change Request Process

- **Feature Enhancement** -- New functionality or improvements to existing features.
- **Bug Fix** -- Resolving technical defects impacting functionality.
- **Infrastructure Change** -- Updates to underlying systems or architecture.
- **Urgent Fixes** -- Emergency changes required for critical business operations (e.g., monthly reporting issues).

### 4.3 Review and Approval

- The **Technical Lead** reviews all requests within **2 business days** of submission.
- Requests are discussed with the **CTO** to evaluate feasibility and priority.
- Approved requests are assigned to a developer in **Jira** and tracked until completion.

### 4.4 Implementation Timeline
